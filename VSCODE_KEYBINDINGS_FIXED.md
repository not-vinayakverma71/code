# 🎯 VS Code Keybindings - FIXED & WORKING

## ✅ What Was Wrong (And Now Fixed)

### **Problem:** Keybindings Only Worked in Insert Mode
The previous patch had `mode = "i"` on all keybindings, which meant they **ONLY worked when you were in INSERT mode** (typing). In vim's NORMAL mode (when you first open Lapce), they didn't work at all!

```toml
# ❌ OLD (BROKEN):
[[keymaps]]
key = "ctrl+b"
command = "toggle_panel_left_visual"
mode = "i"  # ← Only works in INSERT mode!

# ✅ NEW (FIXED):
[[keymaps]]
key = "ctrl+b"
command = "toggle_panel_left_visual"
# ← Works in ALL modes (insert, normal, visual)
```

## 📋 What Still Doesn't Work (Needs Implementation)

These keybindings are mapped but the **commands don't exist in Lapce yet**:

### 🔴 **Critical Missing:**
- `Ctrl+Shift+T` - Reopen Closed Editor (command doesn't exist)
- `Ctrl+H` - Dedicated Replace UI (opens search instead)
- `Shift+Alt+F` - Format Document (no formatter command)

### 🟡 **Medium Priority Missing:**
- `Ctrl+Shift+K` - Delete Entire Line (using delete_forward as workaround)
- `Ctrl+Shift+H` - Replace in Files (using search panel)
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+W` - Close All Editors (closes current only)
- `Ctrl+Shift+[/]` - Fold/Unfold (no code folding yet)
- `Alt+F12` - Peek Definition (jumps instead)
