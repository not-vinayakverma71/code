## 🔧 What's Still Personal (Not in Repo)

Your personal config in `~/.config/lapce-nightly/`:

1. **`keymaps.toml`** - Your 76 keybindings
   - These override the defaults
   - Personal to your machine
   - Others won't get these (they get the 50 built-in ones)

2. **`settings.toml`** - Your theme & settings
   - Personal preferences
   - Not in repo

**Note:** Your personal config has MORE keybindings (76 total) than the defaults (50). The extras are just for you!
