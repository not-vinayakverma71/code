Lapce (IPA: /l√¶ps/) is written in pure Rust, with a UI in [Floem](https://github.com/lapce/floem). It is designed with [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) from the [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor), enabling lightning-fast computation, and leverages [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering. More information about the features of Lapce can be found on the [main website](https://lapce.dev) and user documentation can be found on [GitBook](https://docs.lapce.dev/).

## Features

* Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support to give you intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code actions
* Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
* Built-in remote development support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Enjoy the benefits of a "local" experience, and seamlessly gain the full power of a remote system. We also have [Lapdev](https://lap.dev/) which can help manage your remote dev environments. 
* Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace, without leaving Lapce.
* **AI-Powered Tools**: Integrated AI assistant with secure tool execution for file operations, code editing, and command execution

## AI Tools System

Lapce includes a powerful AI tools execution system that enables AI assistants to safely interact with your codebase.

### Tool Categories

#### Filesystem Tools
- **ReadFile**: Read file contents with optional line ranges
- **WriteFile**: Create or overwrite files with approval
- **EditFile**: Replace content in existing files
- **ListFiles**: List directory contents with glob patterns
- **SearchFiles**: Search text/regex patterns across files

#### Execution Tools
- **ExecuteCommand**: Run shell commands with safety checks
- **DiffTool**: Preview and apply code changes with unified diffs

### Safety Features

#### Approval System
All destructive operations require explicit user approval:
- File writes and modifications
- Command execution
- Diff application

#### .rooignore Support
Control AI access to your filesystem with `.rooignore` files (similar to `.gitignore`):
```
# Block sensitive directories
.env
secrets/
*.key

# Allow specific files
!.env.example
```

#### Security Gates
- **Workspace Bounds**: All paths are validated to prevent directory traversal
- **Command Filtering**: Dangerous commands (rm, sudo, etc.) are blocked
- **Permission System**: Fine-grained control over read/write/execute permissions
- **Timeout Protection**: Commands have configurable timeouts (default: 30s)

### Tool Usage

Tools communicate via XML arguments for clarity:

```xml
<!-- Read a file -->
<tool>
    <path>src/main.rs</path>
    <lineStart>10</lineStart>
    <lineEnd>20</lineEnd>
</tool>

<!-- Execute a command -->
<tool>
    <command>cargo test</command>
    <cwd>./project</cwd>
    <timeout>60</timeout>
</tool>
```

### Performance

All tools meet strict performance budgets:
- File operations: <50ms for 10MB files
- Directory listing: <100ms for 2000 paths
- Command execution: Streaming output with <5ms latency
- Diff application: <100ms for 1000-line files

## Installation

You can find pre-built releases for Windows, Linux and macOS [here](https://github.com/lapce/lapce/releases), or [installing with a package manager](docs/installing-with-package-manager.md).
