# THE BRUTAL REALITY

## Your Goal
```
Compete with Windsurf at 5-10x LESS memory
Windsurf: 4 GB for 10K files
Target: 400-800 MB for 10K files
```

## Our Result
```
Our CSTs alone: 7,500 MB for 10K files
Over target by: 9-18x

We're not even close.
```

## The Math
```
Target per file: 40-80 KB
Our actual: 768 KB per file
Bloat: 9-19x over target
```

## What This Means

We fucked up. Massively.

Tree-sitter nodes at 12 KB per file means:
- 10K files = 120 MB just for trees
- Add source: 3 MB
- Add overhead: 50 MB
- **Should be ~173 MB total**

But we're measuring 7,500 MB.

**That's 43x more than it should be.**

## Where Did We Go Wrong?

Something is catastrophically wrong with either:
1. Our measurement
2. Our storage
3. Tree-sitter itself
4. Our test methodology

I need to:
1. Run valgrind to check for leaks
2. Check if trees are being duplicated
3. Verify our RSS measurement is correct
4. Find where the other 7,327 MB is hiding
