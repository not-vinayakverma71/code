## Status:
✅ **70 language parsers available**
✅ **All dependencies compile successfully**
⏳ **Need to wire up in native_parser_manager.rs, parser_pool.rs, and codex_exact_format.rs**
⏳ **Need query files for new languages**

## Next Steps:
1. Wire up all parsers in the code
2. Add query files for each language
3. Test all 70 languages
