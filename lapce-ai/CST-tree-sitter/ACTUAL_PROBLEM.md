# THE ACTUAL FUCKING PROBLEM

## The Reality

```
Windsurf: 4 GB for 10K files with FULL features (goto def, find refs, etc.)
Our CSTs: 7.5 GB for 10K files with NOTHING

We're 1.9x WORSE for storing LESS.
```

## What We Know For Sure

From our actual tests on massive_test_codebase:

```
3,000 files = 36 MB
12.4 KB per file

Breakdown per file:
- Source text: ~291 bytes (0.3 KB)
- Tree-sitter C nodes: ~12.1 KB
```

## Where The Memory Goes

Tree-sitter allocates nodes in **C heap** (malloc):
- Each node: 80-100 bytes
- Average 100 nodes per file
- **100 nodes × 100 bytes = 10 KB**
- Plus overhead = **12 KB per file**

This is measured by RSS (Resident Set Size), which includes:
- Rust heap
- C heap (where tree-sitter nodes live)
- Stack
- Shared libraries

## The Question Nobody's Answering

**If tree-sitter C nodes are 12 KB per file, how the fuck does Windsurf store CSTs in less memory?**

Possible explanations:

### 1. They DON'T store all CSTs in memory
- Only store hot files
- Parse on demand
- Aggressive eviction
- **But you said they DO load full memory**

### 2. They use a different parser
- Not tree-sitter
- Custom parser with smaller nodes
- **But they support 40+ languages like us**

### 3. They compress/serialize CSTs
- Store trees on disk
- Load on demand
- Keep compressed in memory
- **Possible, but would need investigation**

### 4. Our measurement is wrong
- We're measuring total RSS, not just CST memory
- Includes parser initialization, runtime, etc.
- **But we measured delta from baseline**

### 5. Tree-sitter is leaking memory
- Not properly freeing nodes
- Fragmentation
- **Need to verify with valgrind**

## What We Need To Find Out

1. **Run valgrind** on our test to check for leaks
2. **Serialize trees to disk** and measure serialized size
3. **Profile actual Windsurf** memory usage
4. **Check if we can compress trees** somehow
5. **Verify tree-sitter isn't keeping extra data**

## The Target

If Windsurf can do 4 GB for 10K files with full features:

```
Our target: 2 GB for 10K files (CSTs only, no features)

Current: 7.5 GB
Target: 2 GB
Reduction needed: 3.75x
```

That means **3.3 KB per file** instead of 12.4 KB.

## Possible Solutions

### A. Don't store source text separately
Problem: Tree-sitter needs source text to work
Solution: ???

### B. Serialize trees to binary format
- Custom serialization
- Compress with zstd/lz4
- Could get 5-10x compression
- **12 KB → 1-2 KB**

### C. Use a different tree storage
- Don't use tree-sitter's C trees
- Parse once, convert to compact format
- Store in Rust structs (smaller)
- **Possible but complex**

### D. Actually don't store all trees
- LRU cache of 1K-2K files
- Parse on demand
- **This is what everyone else does**

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Maybe you're right and I've been making excuses.

**Nobody stores all CSTs in memory for 10K files.**

Even with 4 GB, if Windsurf has:
- Electron: 800 MB
- LSPs: 1 GB
- Extensions: 500 MB
- Editor: 400 MB
- Other: 300 MB

That leaves **1 GB for CSTs** for 10K files = **100 KB per file???**

That's 8x what we're using!

## Wait, That Doesn't Make Sense Either

If Windsurf CSTs are 100 KB per file, they're storing WAY MORE than us?

Unless... they're storing something DIFFERENT:

1. **Compressed CSTs**: 12 KB compressed to 1-2 KB
2. **Partial trees**: Only function/class level, not full
3. **Hybrid**: Embeddings + minimal tree for structure
4. **On-demand**: Store index, parse when needed

## What I Need To Do

1. Stop guessing
2. Run actual tests to verify tree-sitter memory
3. Check for leaks with valgrind
4. Implement compression and measure
5. Profile what Windsurf actually does

Your frustration is valid. We have 7.5 GB for something that should be 2 GB or less.
