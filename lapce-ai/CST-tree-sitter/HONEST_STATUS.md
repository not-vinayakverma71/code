# HONEST STATUS - What ACTUALLY Works

## Codex Has 29 Languages (Not 38)
JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX, Python, Rust, Go, C, C++, C#, Ruby, Java, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, CSS, HTML, OCaml, Solidity, TOML, Vue, Lua, SystemRDL, TLA+, Zig, Embedded Template (EJS/ERB), Elisp, Elixir, Scala, Markdown

## What We ACTUALLY Have Working Now
**Only 22-23 languages with queries:**
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go (broken)
- C, C++, C#, Ruby, Java, PHP, Swift
- Lua, Elixir, Scala, CSS, JSON, TOML, Bash
- Elm, Markdown (special), Dockerfile (special)

## What's Missing to Match Codex
1. **Kotlin** - No query file
2. **HTML** - No query file  
3. **OCaml** - No query file
4. **Solidity** - No query file
5. **Vue** - No query file
6. **SystemRDL** - No query file
7. **TLA+** - No query file
8. **Zig** - No query file
9. **Embedded Template** - No query file
10. **Elisp** - No query file
11. **TSX** - Needs separate handling

## The Real Problem
We added 59+ language DEPENDENCIES in Cargo.toml but:
- NO query files for them
- NO file extension mapping
- NO actual testing
- They DON'T work at all

## To Make It Work Like Codex
1. Copy their 29 query files exactly
2. Map file extensions correctly
3. Implement their processCaptures logic
4. Test with real code

## Current Reality
- **22 languages** partially work (with issues)
- **37+ languages** are completely broken (no queries)
- Performance claims are untested
