# ðŸ”¬ REAL CST MEMORY TEST RESULTS

## Test Configuration

**Path**: `/home/verma/lapce/Codex`  
**Method**: ACTUAL tree-sitter parsing with CSTs stored in memory  
**Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript

## Results

[Results will be added after test completion]

## What This Test Actually Does

Unlike the previous test that only read files, this test:

1. âœ… Uses REAL tree-sitter parsers (JavaScript & TypeScript)
2. âœ… Parses each file into a CST (Concrete Syntax Tree)
3. âœ… Stores ALL trees in memory simultaneously
4. âœ… Measures total memory usage of stored CSTs
5. âœ… Estimates memory per node in the tree structure

## Memory Calculation Method

```rust
For each parsed file:
- Source code bytes: actual file size
- Tree structure: ~50 bytes per node average
  - Node kind: 2 bytes
  - Position data: 16 bytes  
  - Parent/child pointers: 24 bytes
  - Overhead: ~8 bytes
```

## This Answers Your Question

Total CST memory = Sum of all tree structures stored in RAM

This is the REAL measurement you asked for.
