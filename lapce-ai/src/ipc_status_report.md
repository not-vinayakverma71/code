# IPC Server Status Report

## Current Status: Hour 12 of Implementation

### Completed (71% of files)
- **37/52 TypeScript files translated**
- Core IPC: ipc-server.ts (135 lines) ✓
- Core IPC: ipc-client.ts (130 lines) ✓  
- EventEmitter pattern ✓
- Message framing ✓
- Basic echo test structure ✓

### Working Components
- Types compile successfully
- Provider definitions translated
- Message structures defined

### Not Working Yet
- IPC socket communication (0%)
- Server/client handshake (0%)
- Message routing (0%)
- Auto-reconnection (0%)

### Performance Requirements: 0/8 Met
1. ❌ Memory < 3MB (unmeasured)
2. ❌ Latency < 10μs (unmeasured)
3. ❌ Throughput > 1M msg/sec (unmeasured)
4. ❌ 1000+ connections (untested)
5. ❌ Zero allocations (not implemented)
6. ❌ Auto-reconnection < 100ms (not working)
7. ❌ Test coverage > 90% (0%)
8. ❌ 10x Node.js (unmeasured)

### Next Steps
1. Fix compilation errors
2. Test basic server startup
3. Verify client can connect
4. Test echo message flow
5. Add reconnection logic

### Time Estimate
- Fix compilation: 1 hour
- Basic IPC working: 2-3 hours
- All requirements: 20+ hours
