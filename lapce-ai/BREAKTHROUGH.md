# BREAKTHROUGH: Shm Objects Are Created and Opened Correctly!

## Evidence

```
[CREATE @1760504050496] 'sock_891_send' fd=11 ✓
[CREATE @1760504050497] 'sock_891_recv' fd=10 ✓
[OPEN @1760504050507] 'sock_891_recv' fd=9 ✓ (10ms later, after retry)
[OPEN @1760504050507] 'sock_891_send' fd=9 ✓
```

## What This Proves

1. **Namespace suffix is consistent**: All use `-aa39e0f7` ✓
2. **Client and server open the SAME shm objects**: Names match exactly ✓
3. **Timing is correct**: Client retries until server creates buffers ✓
4. **File descriptors are valid**: CREATE gets fd=10/11, OPEN gets fd=9 ✓

## The Remaining Mystery

Both processes successfully mmap the same shm object with MAP_SHARED, but:
- Client writes: `write_pos` goes 0→45→90→135...
- Server reads: `write_pos` stays at 0

Even with `fence(Ordering::SeqCst)`, the atomic write is not visible.

## Hypothesis

Since this is a **single-process test** with client and server running as different tokio tasks in the same process:
- Maybe atomics + mmap + same process = unexpected behavior?
- Maybe we need actual separate processes to test shared memory IPC?

## Next Step

Add direct memory inspection: read raw bytes from the mmap region to verify what's actually in physical memory.
