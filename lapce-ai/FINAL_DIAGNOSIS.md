# Final Root Cause: Memory Appears Isolated Despite Correct Setup

## Facts Verified

✅ **Slot IDs match**: Both use slot 969  
✅ **Names match**: Both use `_969_recv` and `_969_send` with same suffix `-aa39e0f7`  
✅ **Direction correct**: Client writes to `_recv`, Handler reads from `_recv`  
✅ **SHM objects exist**: `/dev/shm/tmp_lapce-ipc-integration-test.sock_128_recv-aa39e0f7`  
✅ **Header initialization**: Both see `read_pos=0, write_pos=0` initially  

## The Symptom

Client:
```
[BUFFER WRITE] SUCCESS - Wrote 41 bytes, write_pos now at 45
```

Handler:
```
[BUFFER READ] Attempt 0: read_pos=0, write_pos=0  ← Still sees empty!
```

## Virtual Address Difference is NORMAL

```
CREATE _recv: ptr=0x7c95986fc000
OPEN _recv:   ptr=0x7c95984fa000  ← Different vaddr is OK for MAP_SHARED
```

Different virtual addresses are expected. MAP_SHARED should still share physical memory.

## Hypothesis: Header Pointer Mismatch

In `write()` we log `write_pos` AFTER writing:
```rust
unsafe {
    let header = &*self.header;  // ← Which header?
    let final_write = header.write_pos.load(...);
}
```

In `read()` we check:
```rust
let header = &*self.header;  // ← Same header pointer?
let read_pos = header.read_pos.load(...);
let write_pos = header.write_pos.load(...);
```

**Need to verify both sides are reading from the SAME header in the mmap.**

The issue might be that `self.header` points to a local copy or wrong offset within the mmap.

## Next Step

Log the actual `self.header` pointer address on both write and read to verify they're accessing the same header location within their respective mmaps.
