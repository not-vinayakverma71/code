## Success Metrics ✅

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Memory Usage (100 conn) | < 3MB | N/A | ❌ |
| Connection Reuse Rate | > 95% | N/A | ❌ |
| Acquisition Latency | < 1ms | N/A | ❌ |
| HTTP/2 Streams | 100+ | 0 | ❌ |
| TLS Handshake | < 5ms | N/A | ❌ |
| Test Coverage | > 80% | 0% | ❌ |

## Known Issues & Risks ⚠️

1. **No existing bb8 usage** - Need to learn/integrate from scratch
2. **Hyper 1.0 changes** - API differences from 0.14
3. **Memory target aggressive** - 3MB for 100 connections is tight
4. **Complex dependencies** - Many moving parts to coordinate
5. **Testing complexity** - Need mock servers for testing

## Notes
- Must maintain 1:1 parity with TypeScript implementation from `/home/verma/lapce/Codex/`
- All timeouts and retry values must match exactly
- Do NOT optimize beyond what TypeScript version does
- This implementation took years to perfect - preserve all logic
