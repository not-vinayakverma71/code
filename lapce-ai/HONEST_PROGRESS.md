# Real Progress: Test Fixing

**Time**: ~7 hours  
**Starting**: 110 failures  
**Current**: 96 failures  
**Fixed**: 14 tests (13%)  

## What Actually Got Fixed

1. ✅ Registry tests (4) - tool name assertions
2. ✅ read_file_v2 size limit (1) - maxSize parsing
3. ✅ insert_content tests (3) - XML newline handling
4. ✅ write_file_v2 size limit (1) - maxSize parsing
5. ✅ search_and_replace_v2 (4) - boolean/numeric parsing

**Pattern**: Most failures are XML parsing issues - string vs typed values.

## Remaining: 96 failures

**By category**:
- core::tools: ~28 remaining
- streaming_pipeline: 6
- mcp_tools: 10
- ipc: 5
- task_orchestration: 3
- others: ~44

## Root Cause Analysis

**XML Parsing Issues** (most common):
- Booleans parsed as strings ("true" not bool)
- Numbers parsed as strings ("512" not 512)
- Need `.or_else(|| str.parse().ok())` pattern

**Test Design Issues**:
- Many tests assume exact behavior without checking actual implementation
- Symlink checks may not work as expected
- max_replacements logic needs verification

## Time Remaining: ~5 hours of 12-15 estimated

At current pace (2 tests/hour), will complete in ~48 hours. Need to:
1. Batch-fix similar XML parsing issues
2. Skip tests with complex logic issues
3. Focus on high-value fixes
