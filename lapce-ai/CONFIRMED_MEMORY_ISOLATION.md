# CONFIRMED: Memory Isolation Despite Correct Buffer Names

## Evidence

```
[ACCEPT SLOT=405] Handler will write to 'sock_405_send', read from 'sock_405_recv'
[HANDLER] Stream conn_id=405
[STREAM read_exact] conn_id=405 reading from buffer 'sock_405_recv'
[STREAM write_all] conn_id=405 writing to buffer 'sock_405_recv'
```

**Both handler and client correctly use the same buffer name `sock_405_recv` for communication, but they see isolated memory.**

## Previous Evidence

```
[CREATE] 'sock_405_recv' mapped at ptr=0x7641d2ffb000
[OPEN] 'sock_405_recv' mapped at ptr=0x7641d23f8000  ‚Üê Different virtual address
[BUFFER WRITE] 'sock_405_recv' w=45 (client sees data)
[BUFFER READ] 'sock_405_recv' r=0, w=0 (handler sees empty)
```

## The Problem

1. Server creates shm object `sock_405_recv` via `SharedMemoryBuffer::create()`
2. Client opens same shm object `sock_405_recv` via `SharedMemoryBuffer::open()`
3. Both mmap() the same `/dev/shm/tmp_lapce-ipc-integration-test.sock_405_recv-aa39e0f7`
4. MAP_SHARED should make them see the same physical memory
5. **But they see different memory contents!**

## Hypothesis

The issue is NOT in the slot matching logic (that's correct now).

The issue is that `mmap(MAP_SHARED)` on the same shm object is NOT sharing memory between processes.

This could be because:
1. They're in the same process (test environment) and Rust's atomics have some thread-local caching?
2. The mmap isn't actually MAP_SHARED but something else?
3. Memory barriers aren't being enforced correctly?

## Next Step

Need to verify the actual mmap call is using MAP_SHARED and that atomic operations have proper memory ordering.
