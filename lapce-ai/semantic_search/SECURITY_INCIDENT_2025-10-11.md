# Security Incident Report - AWS Credentials Exposure

**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: REMEDIATED

## Issue

Hardcoded AWS credentials were found in `test_performance.sh`:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: `AKIA2RCKMSFVZ72HLCXD`
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: `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`

## Impact

- Credentials were committed to version control
- Potential unauthorized access to AWS resources
- Risk of service abuse, data exfiltration, or resource consumption

## Remediation Actions

### Completed
1. ✅ Removed hardcoded credentials from `test_performance.sh`
2. ✅ Updated script to require environment variables or AWS config
3. ✅ Added validation checks and helpful error messages

### Required (User Action)
1. **URGENT: Rotate the exposed AWS credentials immediately**
   - Go to AWS IAM Console
   - Delete access key `AKIA2RCKMSFVZ72HLCXD`
   - Generate new access key pair
   - Update credentials in secure storage (AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Actions secrets, etc.)

2. **Audit AWS CloudTrail logs** for the exposed key
   - Check for unauthorized API calls
   - Review resource usage during exposure period
   - Document any suspicious activity

3. **Review all scripts and config files** for additional hardcoded secrets
   - Search for patterns: `AKIA`, `AWS_SECRET`, API keys, tokens
   - Use tools like `git-secrets`, `trufflehog`, or `detect-secrets`

4. **Set up pre-commit hooks** to prevent future incidents
   - Install `pre-commit` framework
   - Add secret scanning hooks
   - Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

## Prevention Measures

### Implemented
- Script now validates environment variables before running
- Clear documentation on how to configure credentials securely
- Supports multiple credential methods (env vars, AWS config, IAM roles)

### Recommended
1. Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for production
2. Use GitHub Actions secrets for CI/CD
3. Enable AWS CloudTrail for all regions
4. Set up AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
5. Implement least-privilege IAM policies
6. Rotate credentials regularly (every 90 days)

## Timeline

- **Exposure**: Unknown (credentials were in repository)
- **Detection**: 2025-10-11 19:14 IST
- **Remediation**: 2025-10-11 19:15 IST (code fixed)
- **Rotation**: PENDING (requires user action)

## Follow-up

- [ ] User rotates AWS credentials
- [ ] User audits CloudTrail logs
- [ ] User sets up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] User reviews other files for secrets
- [ ] Update documentation with security best practices
- [ ] Add secret scanning to CI/CD pipeline
