# PROOF: Client and Server Have ISOLATED Memory

## Evidence from Logs

**Server CREATE:**
```
[CREATE] '.._464_send-aa39e0f7' mapped at ptr=0x7641d30fc000
[CREATE] '.._464_recv-aa39e0f7' mapped at ptr=0x7641d2ffb000
```

**Client OPEN (same shm_name):**
```
[OPEN] '.._464_recv-aa39e0f7' mapped at ptr=0x7641d23f8000  ← Different ptr!
[OPEN] '.._464_send-aa39e0f7' mapped at ptr=0x7641d22f7000  ← Different ptr!
```

**Client writes:**
```
[BUFFER WRITE] SUCCESS - Wrote 41 bytes, write_pos now at 45
```

**Server reads:**
```
[BUFFER READ] Attempt 0: read_pos=0, write_pos=0  ← Empty!
```

## Diagnosis

`MAP_SHARED` mmap on the SAME shm object should share the SAME physical memory even if virtual addresses differ. But ring buffer positions show server sees empty buffer (write_pos=0) while client sees written data (write_pos=45).

This means they're accessing DIFFERENT physical memory regions.

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The shm object might be getting:
1. Deleted and recreated between CREATE and OPEN
2. Created in different namespaces
3. Not actually persisting in `/dev/shm`

Need to:
1. Check if shm objects exist on filesystem: `ls -la /dev/shm/`
2. Verify create_namespaced_path returns same value in both processes
3. Add explicit write+read test to confirm memory isolation
